DEPRECATION WARNING: Method to_hash is deprecated and will be removed in Rails 5.1, as `ActionController::Parameters` no longer inherits from hash. Using this deprecated behavior exposes potential security problems. If you continue to use this method you may be creating a security vulnerability in your app that can be exploited. Instead, consider using one of these documented methods which are not deprecated: http://api.rubyonrails.org/v5.0.1/classes/ActionController/Parameters.html (called from merge! at /Users/Hudhayfa/development/WDI_LDN_PROJECT_4_API/app/controllers/authentications_controller.rb:27)

The story is set in both medieval and modern worlds.\n\nAs in the previous game, the player controls Gabriel Belmont, now known as Dracula, as he fights through an open world. During the game's opening sequence the player is able to control Dracula while he still possesses all his powers as well as all of his weapons. Dracula's main weapon is his Blood Whip, a weapon that is comparable to the Combat Cross from the original Lords of Shadow. Replacing the magic system from the previous game are the Void Sword and the Chaos Claws. The Void Sword can replenish Dracula's health when used while the Chaos Claws can be used to break through enemy defenses and deliver powerful attacks. The story mode in Lords of Shadow 2 has been stated to be far longer than the previous one. The game is mainly an open world allowing the player to choose what route to take.

The narration explains that Alan is attempting to chase down the \"herald of darkness\", Mr. Scratch, who is Alan's evil doppelganger created by a dark force. Scratch is determined to take away everything Alan loves, including his wife, Alice. Alan, as the \"champion of light,\" has the ability to rewrite reality, and was able to write his escape from Cauldron Lake in Washington. He ends up near the small town of Night Springs, Arizona, and learns that he has been missing from the real world for nearly two years.&#13;\nA nearby oil derrick erupts with several foes controlled by Mr. Scratch. Seeking light, Alan runs to a nearby motel, where he encounters Emma Sloan, who at first thinks he is Mr. Scratch, since they look identical. She tells Alan that Scratch was at the motel the night before, and provides Alan with a typewritten page, a way to alter reality to destroy the derrick and stop the foes. Alan follows its instructions, which causes a meteor to collide with an artificial satellite, sending it hurtling towards the ground, where it then collides with the oil derrick. While Alan is away performing this task, the dark forces consume Emma.&#13;\nFollowing clues he found at the motel, along with a set of keys, Alan heads to a nearby observatory. There, Dr. Rachel Meadows, who also met Mr. Scratch previously, is tracking a mysterious signal sent just before the satellite was knocked out of orbit. Rachel tells Alan that Mr. Scratch was very interested in this signal, and Alan surmises that it must contain the key to fighting the darkness. While attempting to obtain the complete signal, the observatory's telescope is sabotaged by the darkness, which reinforces Alan's belief that the signal contains something he needs. After repairing the damage, a portion of the signal comes through that translates into a page of a story: a new reality that Alan can presumably implement.&#13;\nThe page points him to a nearby drive-in theater, where he meets Serena Valdivia, who is under the influence of the darkness. After freeing her by restoring power and switching the lights on, Serena tells Alan that Mr. Scratch is trying to prevent the sun from ever rising again. She gives Alan the security code to the projection room where he can change reality. Alan uses the incomplete message to try to set the new reality. However, as the message is only partial, the new reality does not take effect. Mr. Scratch appears, gloating, and sends Alan back in time to a few hours before.&#13;\nWaking up again near the motel, Alan repeats many of the same motions. Emma and Rachel still have some deja vu of the previous loop's events, and have helped perform some of Alan's previous tasks for him. Despite his efforts to change events this time around, Emma is nevertheless consumed again by the darkness. Rachel is able to capture a longer portion of the signal this time, but it is still incomplete. When Alan returns to the drive-in theater, he is again unable to complete the new reality and is sent back in time again by Mr. Scratch.&#13;\nAlan repeats his actions for a third time, but this time, he is able to save Emma and gain the complete message from Rachel.

The story is set in both medieval and modern worlds.\n\nAs in the previous game, the player controls Gabriel Belmont, now known as Dracula, as he fights through an open world. During the game's opening sequence the player is able to control Dracula while he still possesses all his powers as well as all of his weapons. Dracula's main weapon is his Blood Whip, a weapon that is comparable to the Combat Cross from the original Lords of Shadow. Replacing the magic system from the previous game are the Void Sword and the Chaos Claws. The Void Sword can replenish Dracula's health when used while the Chaos Claws can be used to break through enemy defenses and deliver powerful attacks. The story mode in Lords of Shadow 2 has been stated to be far longer than the previous one. The game is mainly an open world allowing the player to choose what route to take.

The narration explains that Alan is attempting to chase down the \"herald of darkness\", Mr. Scratch, who is Alan's evil doppelganger created by a dark force. Scratch is determined to take away everything Alan loves, including his wife, Alice. Alan, as the \"champion of light,\" has the ability to rewrite reality, and was able to write his escape from Cauldron Lake in Washington. He ends up near the small town of Night Springs, Arizona, and learns that he has been missing from the real world for nearly two years.&#13;\nA nearby oil derrick erupts with several foes controlled by Mr. Scratch. Seeking light, Alan runs to a nearby motel, where he encounters Emma Sloan, who at first thinks he is Mr. Scratch, since they look identical. She tells Alan that Scratch was at the motel the night before, and provides Alan with a typewritten page, a way to alter reality to destroy the derrick and stop the foes. Alan follows its instructions, which causes a meteor to collide with an artificial satellite, sending it hurtling towards the ground, where it then collides with the oil derrick. While Alan is away performing this task, the dark forces consume Emma.&#13;\nFollowing clues he found at the motel, along with a set of keys, Alan heads to a nearby observatory. There, Dr. Rachel Meadows, who also met Mr. Scratch previously, is tracking a mysterious signal sent just before the satellite was knocked out of orbit. Rachel tells Alan that Mr. Scratch was very interested in this signal, and Alan surmises that it must contain the key to fighting the darkness. While attempting to obtain the complete signal, the observatory's telescope is sabotaged by the darkness, which reinforces Alan's belief that the signal contains something he needs. After repairing the damage, a portion of the signal comes through that translates into a page of a story: a new reality that Alan can presumably implement.&#13;\nThe page points him to a nearby drive-in theater, where he meets Serena Valdivia, who is under the influence of the darkness. After freeing her by restoring power and switching the lights on, Serena tells Alan that Mr. Scratch is trying to prevent the sun from ever rising again. She gives Alan the security code to the projection room where he can change reality. Alan uses the incomplete message to try to set the new reality. However, as the message is only partial, the new reality does not take effect. Mr. Scratch appears, gloating, and sends Alan back in time to a few hours before.&#13;\nWaking up again near the motel, Alan repeats many of the same motions. Emma and Rachel still have some deja vu of the previous loop's events, and have helped perform some of Alan's previous tasks for him. Despite his efforts to change events this time around, Emma is nevertheless consumed again by the darkness. Rachel is able to capture a longer portion of the signal this time, but it is still incomplete. When Alan returns to the drive-in theater, he is again unable to complete the new reality and is sent back in time again by Mr. Scratch.&#13;\nAlan repeats his actions for a third time, but this time, he is able to save Emma and gain the complete message from Rachel.

The game was developed by MercurySteam and published by Konami. This is MercurySteam's last contribution to the franchise. The story is set in both medieval and modern worlds.\n\nAs in the previous game, the player controls Gabriel Belmont, now known as Dracula, as he fights through an open world. During the game's opening sequence the player is able to control Dracula while he still possesses all his powers as well as all of his weapons. Dracula's main weapon is his Blood Whip, a weapon that is comparable to the Combat Cross from the original Lords of Shadow. Replacing the magic system from the previous game are the Void Sword and the Chaos Claws. The Void Sword can replenish Dracula's health when used while the Chaos Claws can be used to break through enemy defenses and deliver powerful attacks. The story mode in Lords of Shadow 2 has been stated to be far longer than the previous one. The game is mainly an open world allowing the player to choose what route to take. This game also features a movable camera, something that was not available in the first Lords of Shadow game."], ["critic_rating", 72.5322243046789], ["time_to_beat", 68400], ["pegi_rating", 5], ["cover_img", "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/qpzs3xsa8w2gd0udwqig.png"], ["video_url", "PkS2t-l5fIs"], ["release_date", "1393286400000"], ["genres", "{12,25,31}"], ["platforms", "{6,12,9,9,12,9,12}"], ["screenshots", "{https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/bgjkqkdcrd9k8ilzkll5.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/rppy2wpnhndvvdhp8r7b.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/qubilam1xdnh6zt8ywxn.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/pcqis0z9wxnrmqzgm2r4.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/caonxswkwje73exyerqz.png}"], ["created_at", 2017-02-21 10:56:02 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-02-21 10:56:02 UTC]]

The narration explains that Alan is attempting to chase down the \"herald of darkness\", Mr. Scratch, who is Alan's evil doppelganger created by a dark force. Scratch is determined to take away everything Alan loves, including his wife, Alice. Alan, as the \"champion of light,\" has the ability to rewrite reality, and was able to write his escape from Cauldron Lake in Washington. He ends up near the small town of Night Springs, Arizona, and learns that he has been missing from the real world for nearly two years.&#13;\nA nearby oil derrick erupts with several foes controlled by Mr. Scratch. Seeking light, Alan runs to a nearby motel, where he encounters Emma Sloan, who at first thinks he is Mr. Scratch, since they look identical. She tells Alan that Scratch was at the motel the night before, and provides Alan with a typewritten page, a way to alter reality to destroy the derrick and stop the foes. Alan follows its instructions, which causes a meteor to collide with an artificial satellite, sending it hurtling towards the ground, where it then collides with the oil derrick. While Alan is away performing this task, the dark forces consume Emma.&#13;\nFollowing clues he found at the motel, along with a set of keys, Alan heads to a nearby observatory. There, Dr. Rachel Meadows, who also met Mr. Scratch previously, is tracking a mysterious signal sent just before the satellite was knocked out of orbit. Rachel tells Alan that Mr. Scratch was very interested in this signal, and Alan surmises that it must contain the key to fighting the darkness. While attempting to obtain the complete signal, the observatory's telescope is sabotaged by the darkness, which reinforces Alan's belief that the signal contains something he needs. After repairing the damage, a portion of the signal comes through that translates into a page of a story: a new reality that Alan can presumably implement.&#13;\nThe page points him to a nearby drive-in theater, where he meets Serena Valdivia, who is under the influence of the darkness. After freeing her by restoring power and switching the lights on, Serena tells Alan that Mr. Scratch is trying to prevent the sun from ever rising again. She gives Alan the security code to the projection room where he can change reality. Alan uses the incomplete message to try to set the new reality. However, as the message is only partial, the new reality does not take effect. Mr. Scratch appears, gloating, and sends Alan back in time to a few hours before.&#13;\nWaking up again near the motel, Alan repeats many of the same motions. Emma and Rachel still have some deja vu of the previous loop's events, and have helped perform some of Alan's previous tasks for him. Despite his efforts to change events this time around, Emma is nevertheless consumed again by the darkness. Rachel is able to capture a longer portion of the signal this time, but it is still incomplete. When Alan returns to the drive-in theater, he is again unable to complete the new reality and is sent back in time again by Mr. Scratch.&#13;\nAlan repeats his actions for a third time, but this time, he is able to save Emma and gain the complete message from Rachel. He sets the correct series of events in the projection room, which triggers the projector to show a film made by Alice. Mr. Scratch appears again, but discovers that Alan has successfully written the new reality, and he is burned out of existence by the film. On the screen, Alan appears to reunite with Alice along a sun-lit shoreline; however, the narrator notes that this could quite possibly be just a figment of Alan's imagination, since he is still trapped in the Dark Place.&#13;\nDuring the credits, it is revealed that the name of the episode of Night Springs that Alan wrote himself into was titled \"Return\", a reference to the manuscript he began to type at the end of Special Two: The Writer.&#13;\nAfter completion of the game's credits, Barry wakes up suddenly, believing he has heard Alan's voice."], ["critic_rating", 69.7748508736794], ["time_to_beat", 14400], ["pegi_rating", 5], ["cover_img", "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/nefn5goepduo6ixacfjr.png"], ["video_url", "Dg02_suSIAQ"], ["release_date", "1329868800000"], ["genres", "{31}"], ["platforms", "{36,6,6,6,36,6,6,6}"], ["screenshots", "{https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/pdj3oj2k5bgc0wexddt6.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/wu139npcqcq58lxcf0qe.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/zvnk1n2tqiwh6x7otclo.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/twj9ushrvbym01k4ynia.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/hbpppia7u4cytseppaea.png}"], ["created_at", 2017-02-21 10:56:09 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-02-21 10:56:09 UTC]]

The game was developed by MercurySteam and published by Konami. This is MercurySteam's last contribution to the franchise. The story is set in both medieval and modern worlds.\n\nAs in the previous game, the player controls Gabriel Belmont, now known as Dracula, as he fights through an open world. During the game's opening sequence the player is able to control Dracula while he still possesses all his powers as well as all of his weapons. Dracula's main weapon is his Blood Whip, a weapon that is comparable to the Combat Cross from the original Lords of Shadow. Replacing the magic system from the previous game are the Void Sword and the Chaos Claws. The Void Sword can replenish Dracula's health when used while the Chaos Claws can be used to break through enemy defenses and deliver powerful attacks. The story mode in Lords of Shadow 2 has been stated to be far longer than the previous one. The game is mainly an open world allowing the player to choose what route to take.

The game was developed by MercurySteam and published by Konami. This is MercurySteam's last contribution to the franchise. The story is set in both medieval and modern worlds.\n\nAs in the previous game, the player controls Gabriel Belmont, now known as Dracula, as he fights through an open world. During the game's opening sequence the player is able to control Dracula while he still possesses all his powers as well as all of his weapons. Dracula's main weapon is his Blood Whip, a weapon that is comparable to the Combat Cross from the original Lords of Shadow. Replacing the magic system from the previous game are the Void Sword and the Chaos Claws. The Void Sword can replenish Dracula's health when used while the Chaos Claws can be used to break through enemy defenses and deliver powerful attacks. The story mode in Lords of Shadow 2 has been stated to be far longer than the previous one. The game is mainly an open world allowing the player to choose what route to take.

The narration explains that Alan is attempting to chase down the \"herald of darkness\", Mr. Scratch, who is Alan's evil doppelganger created by a dark force. Scratch is determined to take away everything Alan loves, including his wife, Alice. Alan, as the \"champion of light,\" has the ability to rewrite reality, and was able to write his escape from Cauldron Lake in Washington. He ends up near the small town of Night Springs, Arizona, and learns that he has been missing from the real world for nearly two years.&#13;\nA nearby oil derrick erupts with several foes controlled by Mr. Scratch. Seeking light, Alan runs to a nearby motel, where he encounters Emma Sloan, who at first thinks he is Mr. Scratch, since they look identical. She tells Alan that Scratch was at the motel the night before, and provides Alan with a typewritten page, a way to alter reality to destroy the derrick and stop the foes. Alan follows its instructions, which causes a meteor to collide with an artificial satellite, sending it hurtling towards the ground, where it then collides with the oil derrick. While Alan is away performing this task, the dark forces consume Emma.&#13;\nFollowing clues he found at the motel, along with a set of keys, Alan heads to a nearby observatory. There, Dr. Rachel Meadows, who also met Mr. Scratch previously, is tracking a mysterious signal sent just before the satellite was knocked out of orbit. Rachel tells Alan that Mr. Scratch was very interested in this signal, and Alan surmises that it must contain the key to fighting the darkness. While attempting to obtain the complete signal, the observatory's telescope is sabotaged by the darkness, which reinforces Alan's belief that the signal contains something he needs. After repairing the damage, a portion of the signal comes through that translates into a page of a story: a new reality that Alan can presumably implement.&#13;\nThe page points him to a nearby drive-in theater, where he meets Serena Valdivia, who is under the influence of the darkness. After freeing her by restoring power and switching the lights on, Serena tells Alan that Mr. Scratch is trying to prevent the sun from ever rising again. She gives Alan the security code to the projection room where he can change reality. Alan uses the incomplete message to try to set the new reality. However, as the message is only partial, the new reality does not take effect. Mr. Scratch appears, gloating, and sends Alan back in time to a few hours before.&#13;\nWaking up again near the motel, Alan repeats many of the same motions. Emma and Rachel still have some deja vu of the previous loop's events, and have helped perform some of Alan's previous tasks for him. Despite his efforts to change events this time around, Emma is nevertheless consumed again by the darkness. Rachel is able to capture a longer portion of the signal this time, but it is still incomplete. When Alan returns to the drive-in theater, he is again unable to complete the new reality and is sent back in time again by Mr. Scratch.&#13;\nAlan repeats his actions for a third time, but this time, he is able to save Emma and gain the complete message from Rachel. He sets the correct series of events in the projection room, which triggers the projector to show a film made by Alice. Mr. Scratch appears again, but discovers that Alan has successfully written the new reality, and he is burned out of existence by the film. On the screen, Alan appears to reunite with Alice along a sun-lit shoreline; however, the narrator notes that this could quite possibly be just a figment of Alan's imagination, since he is still trapped in the Dark Place.&#13;\nDuring the credits, it is revealed that the name of the episode of Night Springs that Alan wrote himself into was titled \"Return\", a reference to the manuscript he began to type at the end of Special Two: The Writer.&#13;\nAfter completion of the game's credits, Barry wakes up suddenly, believing he has heard Alan's voice."], ["critic_rating", 69.7748508736794], ["time_to_beat", 14400], ["pegi_rating", 5], ["cover_img", "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/nefn5goepduo6ixacfjr.png"], ["video_url", "Dg02_suSIAQ"], ["release_date", "1329868800000"], ["genres", "{31}"], ["platforms", "{36,6,6,6,36,6,6,6}"], ["screenshots", "{https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/pdj3oj2k5bgc0wexddt6.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/wu139npcqcq58lxcf0qe.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/zvnk1n2tqiwh6x7otclo.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/twj9ushrvbym01k4ynia.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/hbpppia7u4cytseppaea.png}"], ["created_at", 2017-02-21 16:04:25 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-02-21 16:04:25 UTC]]

The Void Sword can replenish Dracula's health when used while the Chaos Claws can be used to break through enemy defenses and deliver powerful attacks.

DEPRECATION WARNING: Method to_hash is deprecated and will be removed in Rails 5.1, as `ActionController::Parameters` no longer inherits from hash. Using this deprecated behavior exposes potential security problems. If you continue to use this method you may be creating a security vulnerability in your app that can be exploited. Instead, consider using one of these documented methods which are not deprecated: http://api.rubyonrails.org/v5.0.1/classes/ActionController/Parameters.html (called from merge! at /Users/Hudhayfa/development/WDI_LDN_PROJECT_4_API/app/controllers/authentications_controller.rb:27)

The game was developed by MercurySteam and published by Konami. This is MercurySteam's last contribution to the franchise. The story is set in both medieval and modern worlds.\n\nAs in the previous game, the player controls Gabriel Belmont, now known as Dracula, as he fights through an open world. During the game's opening sequence the player is able to control Dracula while he still possesses all his powers as well as all of his weapons. Dracula's main weapon is his Blood Whip, a weapon that is comparable to the Combat Cross from the original Lords of Shadow. Replacing the magic system from the previous game are the Void Sword and the Chaos Claws. The Void Sword can replenish Dracula's health when used while the Chaos Claws can be used to break through enemy defenses and deliver powerful attacks. The story mode in Lords of Shadow 2 has been stated to be far longer than the previous one. The game is mainly an open world allowing the player to choose what route to take. This game also features a movable camera, something that was not available in the first Lords of Shadow game."], ["critic_rating", 72.5322243046789], ["time_to_beat", 68400], ["pegi_rating", 5], ["cover_img", "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/qpzs3xsa8w2gd0udwqig.png"], ["video_url", "PkS2t-l5fIs"], ["release_date", "1393286400000"], ["genres", "{12,25,31}"], ["platforms", "{6,12,9}"], ["screenshots", "{https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/bgjkqkdcrd9k8ilzkll5.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/rppy2wpnhndvvdhp8r7b.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/qubilam1xdnh6zt8ywxn.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/pcqis0z9wxnrmqzgm2r4.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/caonxswkwje73exyerqz.png}"], ["created_at", 2017-02-22 17:46:36 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-02-22 17:46:36 UTC]]

The game was developed by MercurySteam and published by Konami. This is MercurySteam's last contribution to the franchise. The story is set in both medieval and modern worlds.\n\nAs in the previous game, the player controls Gabriel Belmont, now known as Dracula, as he fights through an open world. During the game's opening sequence the player is able to control Dracula while he still possesses all his powers as well as all of his weapons. Dracula's main weapon is his Blood Whip, a weapon that is comparable to the Combat Cross from the original Lords of Shadow. Replacing the magic system from the previous game are the Void Sword and the Chaos Claws. The Void Sword can replenish Dracula's health when used while the Chaos Claws can be used to break through enemy defenses and deliver powerful attacks. The story mode in Lords of Shadow 2 has been stated to be far longer than the previous one. The game is mainly an open world allowing the player to choose what route to take. This game also features a movable camera, something that was not available in the first Lords of Shadow game."], ["critic_rating", 72.5322243046789], ["time_to_beat", 68400], ["pegi_rating", 5], ["cover_img", "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/qpzs3xsa8w2gd0udwqig.png"], ["video_url", "PkS2t-l5fIs"], ["release_date", "1393286400000"], ["genres", "{12,25,31}"], ["platforms", "{6,12,9}"], ["screenshots", "{https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/bgjkqkdcrd9k8ilzkll5.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/rppy2wpnhndvvdhp8r7b.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/qubilam1xdnh6zt8ywxn.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/pcqis0z9wxnrmqzgm2r4.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/caonxswkwje73exyerqz.png}"], ["created_at", 2017-02-22 17:57:58 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-02-22 17:57:58 UTC]]

The game was developed by MercurySteam and published by Konami. This is MercurySteam's last contribution to the franchise. The story is set in both medieval and modern worlds.\n\nAs in the previous game, the player controls Gabriel Belmont, now known as Dracula, as he fights through an open world. During the game's opening sequence the player is able to control Dracula while he still possesses all his powers as well as all of his weapons. Dracula's main weapon is his Blood Whip, a weapon that is comparable to the Combat Cross from the original Lords of Shadow. Replacing the magic system from the previous game are the Void Sword and the Chaos Claws. The Void Sword can replenish Dracula's health when used while the Chaos Claws can be used to break through enemy defenses and deliver powerful attacks. The story mode in Lords of Shadow 2 has been stated to be far longer than the previous one. The game is mainly an open world allowing the player to choose what route to take.

The narration explains that Alan is attempting to chase down the \"herald of darkness\", Mr. Scratch, who is Alan's evil doppelganger created by a dark force. Scratch is determined to take away everything Alan loves, including his wife, Alice. Alan, as the \"champion of light,\" has the ability to rewrite reality, and was able to write his escape from Cauldron Lake in Washington. He ends up near the small town of Night Springs, Arizona, and learns that he has been missing from the real world for nearly two years.&#13;\nA nearby oil derrick erupts with several foes controlled by Mr. Scratch. Seeking light, Alan runs to a nearby motel, where he encounters Emma Sloan, who at first thinks he is Mr. Scratch, since they look identical. She tells Alan that Scratch was at the motel the night before, and provides Alan with a typewritten page, a way to alter reality to destroy the derrick and stop the foes. Alan follows its instructions, which causes a meteor to collide with an artificial satellite, sending it hurtling towards the ground, where it then collides with the oil derrick. While Alan is away performing this task, the dark forces consume Emma.&#13;\nFollowing clues he found at the motel, along with a set of keys, Alan heads to a nearby observatory. There, Dr. Rachel Meadows, who also met Mr. Scratch previously, is tracking a mysterious signal sent just before the satellite was knocked out of orbit. Rachel tells Alan that Mr. Scratch was very interested in this signal, and Alan surmises that it must contain the key to fighting the darkness. While attempting to obtain the complete signal, the observatory's telescope is sabotaged by the darkness, which reinforces Alan's belief that the signal contains something he needs. After repairing the damage, a portion of the signal comes through that translates into a page of a story: a new reality that Alan can presumably implement.&#13;\nThe page points him to a nearby drive-in theater, where he meets Serena Valdivia, who is under the influence of the darkness. After freeing her by restoring power and switching the lights on, Serena tells Alan that Mr. Scratch is trying to prevent the sun from ever rising again. She gives Alan the security code to the projection room where he can change reality. Alan uses the incomplete message to try to set the new reality. However, as the message is only partial, the new reality does not take effect. Mr. Scratch appears, gloating, and sends Alan back in time to a few hours before.&#13;\nWaking up again near the motel, Alan repeats many of the same motions. Emma and Rachel still have some deja vu of the previous loop's events, and have helped perform some of Alan's previous tasks for him. Despite his efforts to change events this time around, Emma is nevertheless consumed again by the darkness. Rachel is able to capture a longer portion of the signal this time, but it is still incomplete. When Alan returns to the drive-in theater, he is again unable to complete the new reality and is sent back in time again by Mr. Scratch.&#13;\nAlan repeats his actions for a third time, but this time, he is able to save Emma and gain the complete message from Rachel. He sets the correct series of events in the projection room, which triggers the projector to show a film made by Alice. Mr. Scratch appears again, but discovers that Alan has successfully written the new reality, and he is burned out of existence by the film. On the screen, Alan appears to reunite with Alice along a sun-lit shoreline; however, the narrator notes that this could quite possibly be just a figment of Alan's imagination, since he is still trapped in the Dark Place.&#13;\nDuring the credits, it is revealed that the name of the episode of Night Springs that Alan wrote himself into was titled \"Return\", a reference to the manuscript he began to type at the end of Special Two: The Writer.&#13;\nAfter completion of the game's credits, Barry wakes up suddenly, believing he has heard Alan's voice."], ["critic_rating", 69.7748508736794], ["time_to_beat", 14400], ["pegi_rating", 5], ["cover_img", "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/nefn5goepduo6ixacfjr.png"], ["video_url", "Dg02_suSIAQ"], ["release_date", "1329868800000"], ["genres", "{31}"], ["platforms", "{36,6}"], ["screenshots", "{https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/pdj3oj2k5bgc0wexddt6.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/wu139npcqcq58lxcf0qe.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/zvnk1n2tqiwh6x7otclo.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/twj9ushrvbym01k4ynia.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/hbpppia7u4cytseppaea.png}"], ["created_at", 2017-02-22 18:03:58 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-02-22 18:03:58 UTC]]

The story is set in both medieval and modern worlds.\n\nAs in the previous game, the player controls Gabriel Belmont, now known as Dracula, as he fights through an open world. During the game's opening sequence the player is able to control Dracula while he still possesses all his powers as well as all of his weapons. Dracula's main weapon is his Blood Whip, a weapon that is comparable to the Combat Cross from the original Lords of Shadow. Replacing the magic system from the previous game are the Void Sword and the Chaos Claws. The Void Sword can replenish Dracula's health when used while the Chaos Claws can be used to break through enemy defenses and deliver powerful attacks. The story mode in Lords of Shadow 2 has been stated to be far longer than the previous one. The game is mainly an open world allowing the player to choose what route to take.

The narration explains that Alan is attempting to chase down the \"herald of darkness\", Mr. Scratch, who is Alan's evil doppelganger created by a dark force. Scratch is determined to take away everything Alan loves, including his wife, Alice. Alan, as the \"champion of light,\" has the ability to rewrite reality, and was able to write his escape from Cauldron Lake in Washington. He ends up near the small town of Night Springs, Arizona, and learns that he has been missing from the real world for nearly two years.&#13;\nA nearby oil derrick erupts with several foes controlled by Mr. Scratch. Seeking light, Alan runs to a nearby motel, where he encounters Emma Sloan, who at first thinks he is Mr. Scratch, since they look identical. She tells Alan that Scratch was at the motel the night before, and provides Alan with a typewritten page, a way to alter reality to destroy the derrick and stop the foes. Alan follows its instructions, which causes a meteor to collide with an artificial satellite, sending it hurtling towards the ground, where it then collides with the oil derrick. While Alan is away performing this task, the dark forces consume Emma.&#13;\nFollowing clues he found at the motel, along with a set of keys, Alan heads to a nearby observatory. There, Dr. Rachel Meadows, who also met Mr. Scratch previously, is tracking a mysterious signal sent just before the satellite was knocked out of orbit. Rachel tells Alan that Mr. Scratch was very interested in this signal, and Alan surmises that it must contain the key to fighting the darkness. While attempting to obtain the complete signal, the observatory's telescope is sabotaged by the darkness, which reinforces Alan's belief that the signal contains something he needs. After repairing the damage, a portion of the signal comes through that translates into a page of a story: a new reality that Alan can presumably implement.&#13;\nThe page points him to a nearby drive-in theater, where he meets Serena Valdivia, who is under the influence of the darkness. After freeing her by restoring power and switching the lights on, Serena tells Alan that Mr. Scratch is trying to prevent the sun from ever rising again. She gives Alan the security code to the projection room where he can change reality. Alan uses the incomplete message to try to set the new reality. However, as the message is only partial, the new reality does not take effect. Mr. Scratch appears, gloating, and sends Alan back in time to a few hours before.&#13;\nWaking up again near the motel, Alan repeats many of the same motions. Emma and Rachel still have some deja vu of the previous loop's events, and have helped perform some of Alan's previous tasks for him. Despite his efforts to change events this time around, Emma is nevertheless consumed again by the darkness. Rachel is able to capture a longer portion of the signal this time, but it is still incomplete.

The story is set in both medieval and modern worlds.\n\nAs in the previous game, the player controls Gabriel Belmont, now known as Dracula, as he fights through an open world. During the game's opening sequence the player is able to control Dracula while he still possesses all his powers as well as all of his weapons. Dracula's main weapon is his Blood Whip, a weapon that is comparable to the Combat Cross from the original Lords of Shadow. Replacing the magic system from the previous game are the Void Sword and the Chaos Claws. The Void Sword can replenish Dracula's health when used while the Chaos Claws can be used to break through enemy defenses and deliver powerful attacks. The story mode in Lords of Shadow 2 has been stated to be far longer than the previous one. The game is mainly an open world allowing the player to choose what route to take.

The narration explains that Alan is attempting to chase down the \"herald of darkness\", Mr. Scratch, who is Alan's evil doppelganger created by a dark force. Scratch is determined to take away everything Alan loves, including his wife, Alice. Alan, as the \"champion of light,\" has the ability to rewrite reality, and was able to write his escape from Cauldron Lake in Washington. He ends up near the small town of Night Springs, Arizona, and learns that he has been missing from the real world for nearly two years.&#13;\nA nearby oil derrick erupts with several foes controlled by Mr. Scratch. Seeking light, Alan runs to a nearby motel, where he encounters Emma Sloan, who at first thinks he is Mr. Scratch, since they look identical. She tells Alan that Scratch was at the motel the night before, and provides Alan with a typewritten page, a way to alter reality to destroy the derrick and stop the foes. Alan follows its instructions, which causes a meteor to collide with an artificial satellite, sending it hurtling towards the ground, where it then collides with the oil derrick. While Alan is away performing this task, the dark forces consume Emma.&#13;\nFollowing clues he found at the motel, along with a set of keys, Alan heads to a nearby observatory. There, Dr. Rachel Meadows, who also met Mr. Scratch previously, is tracking a mysterious signal sent just before the satellite was knocked out of orbit. Rachel tells Alan that Mr. Scratch was very interested in this signal, and Alan surmises that it must contain the key to fighting the darkness. While attempting to obtain the complete signal, the observatory's telescope is sabotaged by the darkness, which reinforces Alan's belief that the signal contains something he needs. After repairing the damage, a portion of the signal comes through that translates into a page of a story: a new reality that Alan can presumably implement.&#13;\nThe page points him to a nearby drive-in theater, where he meets Serena Valdivia, who is under the influence of the darkness. After freeing her by restoring power and switching the lights on, Serena tells Alan that Mr. Scratch is trying to prevent the sun from ever rising again. She gives Alan the security code to the projection room where he can change reality. Alan uses the incomplete message to try to set the new reality. However, as the message is only partial, the new reality does not take effect. Mr. Scratch appears, gloating, and sends Alan back in time to a few hours before.&#13;\nWaking up again near the motel, Alan repeats many of the same motions. Emma and Rachel still have some deja vu of the previous loop's events, and have helped perform some of Alan's previous tasks for him. Despite his efforts to change events this time around, Emma is nevertheless consumed again by the darkness. Rachel is able to capture a longer portion of the signal this time, but it is still incomplete. When Alan returns to the drive-in theater, he is again unable to complete the new reality and is sent back in time again by Mr. Scratch.&#13;\nAlan repeats his actions for a third time, but this time, he is able to save Emma and gain the complete message from Rachel. He sets the correct series of events in the projection room, which triggers the projector to show a film made by Alice. Mr. Scratch appears again, but discovers that Alan has successfully written the new reality, and he is burned out of existence by the film. On the screen, Alan appears to reunite with Alice along a sun-lit shoreline; however, the narrator notes that this could quite possibly be just a figment of Alan's imagination, since he is still trapped in the Dark Place.&#13;\nDuring the credits, it is revealed that the name of the episode of Night Springs that Alan wrote himself into was titled \"Return\", a reference to the manuscript he began to type at the end of Special Two: The Writer.&#13;\nAfter completion of the game's credits, Barry wakes up suddenly, believing he has heard Alan's voice."], ["critic_rating", 69.7748508736794], ["time_to_beat", 14400], ["pegi_rating", 5], ["cover_img", "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/nefn5goepduo6ixacfjr.png"], ["video_url", "Dg02_suSIAQ"], ["release_date", "1329868800000"], ["genres", "{31}"], ["platforms", "{36,6}"], ["screenshots", "{https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/pdj3oj2k5bgc0wexddt6.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/wu139npcqcq58lxcf0qe.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/zvnk1n2tqiwh6x7otclo.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/twj9ushrvbym01k4ynia.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/hbpppia7u4cytseppaea.png}"], ["created_at", 2017-02-22 18:32:42 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-02-22 18:32:42 UTC]]

The game will mark a new beginning for the Alone in the Dark series."], ["critic_rating", 60.0981707502195], ["time_to_beat", 0], ["pegi_rating", 5], ["cover_img", "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/beosp3v4xcbw7rs6dld2.png"], ["video_url", "BjIQXUtjrSA"], ["release_date", "1213920000000"], ["genres", "{5,9,31}"], ["platforms", "{9,12,5,8,6}"], ["screenshots", "{https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/yymkkskuhfmjrywl5rvs.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/yo3hmvdp4imazgr2uet6.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/jtaogwm1m8urletyftfw.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/lxbfd9q4am0k6k48fsww.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/dzyqkswwcuoiuno17a42.png}"], ["created_at", 2017-02-22 18:32:57 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-02-22 18:32:57 UTC]]

The story is set in both medieval and modern worlds.\n\nAs in the previous game, the player controls Gabriel Belmont, now known as Dracula, as he fights through an open world. During the game's opening sequence the player is able to control Dracula while he still possesses all his powers as well as all of his weapons. Dracula's main weapon is his Blood Whip, a weapon that is comparable to the Combat Cross from the original Lords of Shadow. Replacing the magic system from the previous game are the Void Sword and the Chaos Claws. The Void Sword can replenish Dracula's health when used while the Chaos Claws can be used to break through enemy defenses and deliver powerful attacks. The story mode in Lords of Shadow 2 has been stated to be far longer than the previous one. The game is mainly an open world allowing the player to choose what route to take.

The narration explains that Alan is attempting to chase down the \"herald of darkness\", Mr. Scratch, who is Alan's evil doppelganger created by a dark force. Scratch is determined to take away everything Alan loves, including his wife, Alice. Alan, as the \"champion of light,\" has the ability to rewrite reality, and was able to write his escape from Cauldron Lake in Washington. He ends up near the small town of Night Springs, Arizona, and learns that he has been missing from the real world for nearly two years.&#13;\nA nearby oil derrick erupts with several foes controlled by Mr. Scratch. Seeking light, Alan runs to a nearby motel, where he encounters Emma Sloan, who at first thinks he is Mr. Scratch, since they look identical. She tells Alan that Scratch was at the motel the night before, and provides Alan with a typewritten page, a way to alter reality to destroy the derrick and stop the foes. Alan follows its instructions, which causes a meteor to collide with an artificial satellite, sending it hurtling towards the ground, where it then collides with the oil derrick. While Alan is away performing this task, the dark forces consume Emma.&#13;\nFollowing clues he found at the motel, along with a set of keys, Alan heads to a nearby observatory. There, Dr. Rachel Meadows, who also met Mr. Scratch previously, is tracking a mysterious signal sent just before the satellite was knocked out of orbit. Rachel tells Alan that Mr. Scratch was very interested in this signal, and Alan surmises that it must contain the key to fighting the darkness. While attempting to obtain the complete signal, the observatory's telescope is sabotaged by the darkness, which reinforces Alan's belief that the signal contains something he needs. After repairing the damage, a portion of the signal comes through that translates into a page of a story: a new reality that Alan can presumably implement.&#13;\nThe page points him to a nearby drive-in theater, where he meets Serena Valdivia, who is under the influence of the darkness. After freeing her by restoring power and switching the lights on, Serena tells Alan that Mr. Scratch is trying to prevent the sun from ever rising again. She gives Alan the security code to the projection room where he can change reality. Alan uses the incomplete message to try to set the new reality. However, as the message is only partial, the new reality does not take effect. Mr. Scratch appears, gloating, and sends Alan back in time to a few hours before.&#13;\nWaking up again near the motel, Alan repeats many of the same motions. Emma and Rachel still have some deja vu of the previous loop's events, and have helped perform some of Alan's previous tasks for him. Despite his efforts to change events this time around, Emma is nevertheless consumed again by the darkness. Rachel is able to capture a longer portion of the signal this time, but it is still incomplete. When Alan returns to the drive-in theater, he is again unable to complete the new reality and is sent back in time again by Mr. Scratch.&#13;\nAlan repeats his actions for a third time, but this time, he is able to save Emma and gain the complete message from Rachel. He sets the correct series of events in the projection room, which triggers the projector to show a film made by Alice. Mr. Scratch appears again, but discovers that Alan has successfully written the new reality, and he is burned out of existence by the film. On the screen, Alan appears to reunite with Alice along a sun-lit shoreline; however, the narrator notes that this could quite possibly be just a figment of Alan's imagination, since he is still trapped in the Dark Place.&#13;\nDuring the credits, it is revealed that the name of the episode of Night Springs that Alan wrote himself into was titled \"Return\", a reference to the manuscript he began to type at the end of Special Two: The Writer.&#13;\nAfter completion of the game's credits, Barry wakes up suddenly, believing he has heard Alan's voice."], ["critic_rating", 69.7748508736794], ["time_to_beat", 14400], ["pegi_rating", 5], ["cover_img", "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/nefn5goepduo6ixacfjr.png"], ["video_url", "Dg02_suSIAQ"], ["release_date", "1329868800000"], ["genres", "{31}"], ["platforms", "{36,6}"], ["screenshots", "{https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/pdj3oj2k5bgc0wexddt6.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/wu139npcqcq58lxcf0qe.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/zvnk1n2tqiwh6x7otclo.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/twj9ushrvbym01k4ynia.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/hbpppia7u4cytseppaea.png}"], ["created_at", 2017-02-22 18:36:47 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-02-22 18:36:47 UTC]]

The game was developed by MercurySteam and published by Konami. This is MercurySteam's last contribution to the franchise. The story is set in both medieval and modern worlds.\n\nAs in the previous game, the player controls Gabriel Belmont, now known as Dracula, as he fights through an open world. During the game's opening sequence the player is able to control Dracula while he still possesses all his powers as well as all of his weapons. Dracula's main weapon is his Blood Whip, a weapon that is comparable to the Combat Cross from the original Lords of Shadow. Replacing the magic system from the previous game are the Void Sword and the Chaos Claws. The Void Sword can replenish Dracula's health when used while the Chaos Claws can be used to break through enemy defenses and deliver powerful attacks. The story mode in Lords of Shadow 2 has been stated to be far longer than the previous one. The game is mainly an open world allowing the player to choose what route to take.

The narration explains that Alan is attempting to chase down the \"herald of darkness\", Mr. Scratch, who is Alan's evil doppelganger created by a dark force. Scratch is determined to take away everything Alan loves, including his wife, Alice. Alan, as the \"champion of light,\" has the ability to rewrite reality, and was able to write his escape from Cauldron Lake in Washington. He ends up near the small town of Night Springs, Arizona, and learns that he has been missing from the real world for nearly two years.&#13;\nA nearby oil derrick erupts with several foes controlled by Mr. Scratch. Seeking light, Alan runs to a nearby motel, where he encounters Emma Sloan, who at first thinks he is Mr. Scratch, since they look identical. She tells Alan that Scratch was at the motel the night before, and provides Alan with a typewritten page, a way to alter reality to destroy the derrick and stop the foes. Alan follows its instructions, which causes a meteor to collide with an artificial satellite, sending it hurtling towards the ground, where it then collides with the oil derrick. While Alan is away performing this task, the dark forces consume Emma.&#13;\nFollowing clues he found at the motel, along with a set of keys, Alan heads to a nearby observatory. There, Dr. Rachel Meadows, who also met Mr. Scratch previously, is tracking a mysterious signal sent just before the satellite was knocked out of orbit. Rachel tells Alan that Mr. Scratch was very interested in this signal, and Alan surmises that it must contain the key to fighting the darkness. While attempting to obtain the complete signal, the observatory's telescope is sabotaged by the darkness, which reinforces Alan's belief that the signal contains something he needs. After repairing the damage, a portion of the signal comes through that translates into a page of a story: a new reality that Alan can presumably implement.&#13;\nThe page points him to a nearby drive-in theater, where he meets Serena Valdivia, who is under the influence of the darkness. After freeing her by restoring power and switching the lights on, Serena tells Alan that Mr. Scratch is trying to prevent the sun from ever rising again. She gives Alan the security code to the projection room where he can change reality. Alan uses the incomplete message to try to set the new reality. However, as the message is only partial, the new reality does not take effect. Mr. Scratch appears, gloating, and sends Alan back in time to a few hours before.&#13;\nWaking up again near the motel, Alan repeats many of the same motions. Emma and Rachel still have some deja vu of the previous loop's events, and have helped perform some of Alan's previous tasks for him. Despite his efforts to change events this time around, Emma is nevertheless consumed again by the darkness. Rachel is able to capture a longer portion of the signal this time, but it is still incomplete. When Alan returns to the drive-in theater, he is again unable to complete the new reality and is sent back in time again by Mr. Scratch.&#13;\nAlan repeats his actions for a third time, but this time, he is able to save Emma and gain the complete message from Rachel. He sets the correct series of events in the projection room, which triggers the projector to show a film made by Alice. Mr. Scratch appears again, but discovers that Alan has successfully written the new reality, and he is burned out of existence by the film. On the screen, Alan appears to reunite with Alice along a sun-lit shoreline; however, the narrator notes that this could quite possibly be just a figment of Alan's imagination, since he is still trapped in the Dark Place.&#13;\nDuring the credits, it is revealed that the name of the episode of Night Springs that Alan wrote himself into was titled \"Return\", a reference to the manuscript he began to type at the end of Special Two: The Writer.&#13;\nAfter completion of the game's credits, Barry wakes up suddenly, believing he has heard Alan's voice."], ["critic_rating", 69.7748508736794], ["time_to_beat", 14400], ["pegi_rating", 5], ["cover_img", "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/nefn5goepduo6ixacfjr.png"], ["video_url", "Dg02_suSIAQ"], ["release_date", "1329868800000"], ["genres", "{31}"], ["platforms", "{36,6}"], ["screenshots", "{https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/pdj3oj2k5bgc0wexddt6.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/wu139npcqcq58lxcf0qe.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/zvnk1n2tqiwh6x7otclo.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/twj9ushrvbym01k4ynia.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/hbpppia7u4cytseppaea.png}"], ["created_at", 2017-02-22 18:40:35 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-02-22 18:40:35 UTC]]

The story is set in both medieval and modern worlds.\n\nAs in the previous game, the player controls Gabriel Belmont, now known as Dracula, as he fights through an open world. During the game's opening sequence the player is able to control Dracula while he still possesses all his powers as well as all of his weapons. Dracula's main weapon is his Blood Whip, a weapon that is comparable to the Combat Cross from the original Lords of Shadow. Replacing the magic system from the previous game are the Void Sword and the Chaos Claws. The Void Sword can replenish Dracula's health when used while the Chaos Claws can be used to break through enemy defenses and deliver powerful attacks. The story mode in Lords of Shadow 2 has been stated to be far longer than the previous one. The game is mainly an open world allowing the player to choose what route to take.

The narration explains that Alan is attempting to chase down the \"herald of darkness\", Mr. Scratch, who is Alan's evil doppelganger created by a dark force. Scratch is determined to take away everything Alan loves, including his wife, Alice. Alan, as the \"champion of light,\" has the ability to rewrite reality, and was able to write his escape from Cauldron Lake in Washington. He ends up near the small town of Night Springs, Arizona, and learns that he has been missing from the real world for nearly two years.&#13;\nA nearby oil derrick erupts with several foes controlled by Mr. Scratch. Seeking light, Alan runs to a nearby motel, where he encounters Emma Sloan, who at first thinks he is Mr. Scratch, since they look identical. She tells Alan that Scratch was at the motel the night before, and provides Alan with a typewritten page, a way to alter reality to destroy the derrick and stop the foes. Alan follows its instructions, which causes a meteor to collide with an artificial satellite, sending it hurtling towards the ground, where it then collides with the oil derrick. While Alan is away performing this task, the dark forces consume Emma.&#13;\nFollowing clues he found at the motel, along with a set of keys, Alan heads to a nearby observatory. There, Dr. Rachel Meadows, who also met Mr. Scratch previously, is tracking a mysterious signal sent just before the satellite was knocked out of orbit. Rachel tells Alan that Mr. Scratch was very interested in this signal, and Alan surmises that it must contain the key to fighting the darkness. While attempting to obtain the complete signal, the observatory's telescope is sabotaged by the darkness, which reinforces Alan's belief that the signal contains something he needs. After repairing the damage, a portion of the signal comes through that translates into a page of a story: a new reality that Alan can presumably implement.&#13;\nThe page points him to a nearby drive-in theater, where he meets Serena Valdivia, who is under the influence of the darkness. After freeing her by restoring power and switching the lights on, Serena tells Alan that Mr. Scratch is trying to prevent the sun from ever rising again. She gives Alan the security code to the projection room where he can change reality. Alan uses the incomplete message to try to set the new reality. However, as the message is only partial, the new reality does not take effect. Mr. Scratch appears, gloating, and sends Alan back in time to a few hours before.&#13;\nWaking up again near the motel, Alan repeats many of the same motions. Emma and Rachel still have some deja vu of the previous loop's events, and have helped perform some of Alan's previous tasks for him. Despite his efforts to change events this time around, Emma is nevertheless consumed again by the darkness. Rachel is able to capture a longer portion of the signal this time, but it is still incomplete. When Alan returns to the drive-in theater, he is again unable to complete the new reality and is sent back in time again by Mr. Scratch.&#13;\nAlan repeats his actions for a third time, but this time, he is able to save Emma and gain the complete message from Rachel. He sets the correct series of events in the projection room, which triggers the projector to show a film made by Alice. Mr. Scratch appears again, but discovers that Alan has successfully written the new reality, and he is burned out of existence by the film. On the screen, Alan appears to reunite with Alice along a sun-lit shoreline; however, the narrator notes that this could quite possibly be just a figment of Alan's imagination, since he is still trapped in the Dark Place.&#13;\nDuring the credits, it is revealed that the name of the episode of Night Springs that Alan wrote himself into was titled \"Return\", a reference to the manuscript he began to type at the end of Special Two: The Writer.&#13;\nAfter completion of the game's credits, Barry wakes up suddenly, believing he has heard Alan's voice."], ["critic_rating", 69.7748508736794], ["time_to_beat", 14400], ["pegi_rating", 5], ["cover_img", "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/nefn5goepduo6ixacfjr.png"], ["video_url", "Dg02_suSIAQ"], ["release_date", "1329868800000"], ["genres", "{31}"], ["platforms", "{36,6}"], ["screenshots", "{https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/pdj3oj2k5bgc0wexddt6.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/wu139npcqcq58lxcf0qe.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/zvnk1n2tqiwh6x7otclo.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/twj9ushrvbym01k4ynia.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/hbpppia7u4cytseppaea.png}"], ["created_at", 2017-02-22 19:09:30 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-02-22 19:09:30 UTC]]

With approximately 30-40 minutes of gameplay comprising each episode, the structure of Alone in the Dark pulls you into world that delivers a fiercely gripping and terrifying experience. Each time the player launches a saved game, the episode will begin with a video summary of the previous episode to quickly re-immerse the player in the story and removing the need to remember where they were or what they were doing. Every episode will close with a nail-biting cliff-hanger ending to rattle players' nerves, and if the player is leaving the game a video teaser of the next episode will play to leave them wanting more.\n\nAlone in the Dark will provide a complete next-generation, action packed experience within a highly detailed, free roaming environment, featuring a mixture of real-time physics and full environmental interaction.

  Parameters: {"library"=>{"id"=>1, "played"=>true, "owned"=>true, "game"=>{"id"=>1, "title"=>"Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2", "description"=>"Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 is an action-adventure game and a sequel to the 2010 game, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow, and the 35th installment on the Castlevania franchise. The game was developed by MercurySteam and published by Konami. This is MercurySteam's last contribution to the franchise. The story is set in both medieval and modern worlds.\n\nAs in the previous game, the player controls Gabriel Belmont, now known as Dracula, as he fights through an open world. During the game's opening sequence the player is able to control Dracula while he still possesses all his powers as well as all of his weapons. Dracula's main weapon is his Blood Whip, a weapon that is comparable to the Combat Cross from the original Lords of Shadow. Replacing the magic system from the previous game are the Void Sword and the Chaos Claws. The Void Sword can replenish Dracula's health when used while the Chaos Claws can be used to break through enemy defenses and deliver powerful attacks. The story mode in Lords of Shadow 2 has been stated to be far longer than the previous one. The game is mainly an open world allowing the player to choose what route to take. This game also features a movable camera, something that was not available in the first Lords of Shadow game.", "critic_rating"=>72.5322243046789, "time_to_beat"=>68400, "pegi_rating"=>5, "cover_img"=>"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/qpzs3xsa8w2gd0udwqig.png", "video_url"=>"PkS2t-l5fIs", "screenshots"=>["https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/bgjkqkdcrd9k8ilzkll5.png", "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/rppy2wpnhndvvdhp8r7b.png", "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/qubilam1xdnh6zt8ywxn.png", "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/pcqis0z9wxnrmqzgm2r4.png", "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/caonxswkwje73exyerqz.png"], "genres"=>[12, 25, 31], "platforms"=>[6, 12, 9], "release_date"=>"1393286400000"}, "user"=>{"id"=>1, "username"=>"Hudhayfa"}}, "id"=>"1"}

The game was developed by MercurySteam and published by Konami. This is MercurySteam's last contribution to the franchise. The story is set in both medieval and modern worlds.\n\nAs in the previous game, the player controls Gabriel Belmont, now known as Dracula, as he fights through an open world. During the game's opening sequence the player is able to control Dracula while he still possesses all his powers as well as all of his weapons. Dracula's main weapon is his Blood Whip, a weapon that is comparable to the Combat Cross from the original Lords of Shadow. Replacing the magic system from the previous game are the Void Sword and the Chaos Claws. The Void Sword can replenish Dracula's health when used while the Chaos Claws can be used to break through enemy defenses and deliver powerful attacks. The story mode in Lords of Shadow 2 has been stated to be far longer than the previous one. The game is mainly an open world allowing the player to choose what route to take.

The narration explains that Alan is attempting to chase down the \"herald of darkness\", Mr. Scratch, who is Alan's evil doppelganger created by a dark force. Scratch is determined to take away everything Alan loves, including his wife, Alice. Alan, as the \"champion of light,\" has the ability to rewrite reality, and was able to write his escape from Cauldron Lake in Washington. He ends up near the small town of Night Springs, Arizona, and learns that he has been missing from the real world for nearly two years.&#13;\nA nearby oil derrick erupts with several foes controlled by Mr. Scratch. Seeking light, Alan runs to a nearby motel, where he encounters Emma Sloan, who at first thinks he is Mr. Scratch, since they look identical. She tells Alan that Scratch was at the motel the night before, and provides Alan with a typewritten page, a way to alter reality to destroy the derrick and stop the foes. Alan follows its instructions, which causes a meteor to collide with an artificial satellite, sending it hurtling towards the ground, where it then collides with the oil derrick. While Alan is away performing this task, the dark forces consume Emma.&#13;\nFollowing clues he found at the motel, along with a set of keys, Alan heads to a nearby observatory. There, Dr. Rachel Meadows, who also met Mr. Scratch previously, is tracking a mysterious signal sent just before the satellite was knocked out of orbit. Rachel tells Alan that Mr. Scratch was very interested in this signal, and Alan surmises that it must contain the key to fighting the darkness. While attempting to obtain the complete signal, the observatory's telescope is sabotaged by the darkness, which reinforces Alan's belief that the signal contains something he needs. After repairing the damage, a portion of the signal comes through that translates into a page of a story: a new reality that Alan can presumably implement.&#13;\nThe page points him to a nearby drive-in theater, where he meets Serena Valdivia, who is under the influence of the darkness. After freeing her by restoring power and switching the lights on, Serena tells Alan that Mr. Scratch is trying to prevent the sun from ever rising again. She gives Alan the security code to the projection room where he can change reality. Alan uses the incomplete message to try to set the new reality. However, as the message is only partial, the new reality does not take effect. Mr. Scratch appears, gloating, and sends Alan back in time to a few hours before.&#13;\nWaking up again near the motel, Alan repeats many of the same motions. Emma and Rachel still have some deja vu of the previous loop's events, and have helped perform some of Alan's previous tasks for him. Despite his efforts to change events this time around, Emma is nevertheless consumed again by the darkness. Rachel is able to capture a longer portion of the signal this time, but it is still incomplete. When Alan returns to the drive-in theater, he is again unable to complete the new reality and is sent back in time again by Mr. Scratch.&#13;\nAlan repeats his actions for a third time, but this time, he is able to save Emma and gain the complete message from Rachel. He sets the correct series of events in the projection room, which triggers the projector to show a film made by Alice. Mr. Scratch appears again, but discovers that Alan has successfully written the new reality, and he is burned out of existence by the film. On the screen, Alan appears to reunite with Alice along a sun-lit shoreline; however, the narrator notes that this could quite possibly be just a figment of Alan's imagination, since he is still trapped in the Dark Place.&#13;\nDuring the credits, it is revealed that the name of the episode of Night Springs that Alan wrote himself into was titled \"Return\", a reference to the manuscript he began to type at the end of Special Two: The Writer.&#13;\nAfter completion of the game's credits, Barry wakes up suddenly, believing he has heard Alan's voice."], ["critic_rating", 69.7748508736794], ["time_to_beat", 14400], ["pegi_rating", 5], ["cover_img", "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/nefn5goepduo6ixacfjr.png"], ["video_url", "Dg02_suSIAQ"], ["release_date", "1329868800000"], ["genres", "{31}"], ["platforms", "{36,6}"], ["screenshots", "{https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/pdj3oj2k5bgc0wexddt6.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/wu139npcqcq58lxcf0qe.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/zvnk1n2tqiwh6x7otclo.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/twj9ushrvbym01k4ynia.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/hbpppia7u4cytseppaea.png}"], ["created_at", 2017-02-22 19:13:02 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-02-22 19:13:02 UTC]]

The game was developed by MercurySteam and published by Konami. This is MercurySteam's last contribution to the franchise. The story is set in both medieval and modern worlds.\n\nAs in the previous game, the player controls Gabriel Belmont, now known as Dracula, as he fights through an open world. During the game's opening sequence the player is able to control Dracula while he still possesses all his powers as well as all of his weapons. Dracula's main weapon is his Blood Whip, a weapon that is comparable to the Combat Cross from the original Lords of Shadow. Replacing the magic system from the previous game are the Void Sword and the Chaos Claws.

The narration explains that Alan is attempting to chase down the \"herald of darkness\", Mr. Scratch, who is Alan's evil doppelganger created by a dark force. Scratch is determined to take away everything Alan loves, including his wife, Alice. Alan, as the \"champion of light,\" has the ability to rewrite reality, and was able to write his escape from Cauldron Lake in Washington. He ends up near the small town of Night Springs, Arizona, and learns that he has been missing from the real world for nearly two years.&#13;\nA nearby oil derrick erupts with several foes controlled by Mr. Scratch. Seeking light, Alan runs to a nearby motel, where he encounters Emma Sloan, who at first thinks he is Mr. Scratch, since they look identical. She tells Alan that Scratch was at the motel the night before, and provides Alan with a typewritten page, a way to alter reality to destroy the derrick and stop the foes. Alan follows its instructions, which causes a meteor to collide with an artificial satellite, sending it hurtling towards the ground, where it then collides with the oil derrick. While Alan is away performing this task, the dark forces consume Emma.&#13;\nFollowing clues he found at the motel, along with a set of keys, Alan heads to a nearby observatory. There, Dr. Rachel Meadows, who also met Mr. Scratch previously, is tracking a mysterious signal sent just before the satellite was knocked out of orbit. Rachel tells Alan that Mr. Scratch was very interested in this signal, and Alan surmises that it must contain the key to fighting the darkness. While attempting to obtain the complete signal, the observatory's telescope is sabotaged by the darkness, which reinforces Alan's belief that the signal contains something he needs. After repairing the damage, a portion of the signal comes through that translates into a page of a story: a new reality that Alan can presumably implement.&#13;\nThe page points him to a nearby drive-in theater, where he meets Serena Valdivia, who is under the influence of the darkness. After freeing her by restoring power and switching the lights on, Serena tells Alan that Mr. Scratch is trying to prevent the sun from ever rising again. She gives Alan the security code to the projection room where he can change reality. Alan uses the incomplete message to try to set the new reality. However, as the message is only partial, the new reality does not take effect. Mr. Scratch appears, gloating, and sends Alan back in time to a few hours before.&#13;\nWaking up again near the motel, Alan repeats many of the same motions. Emma and Rachel still have some deja vu of the previous loop's events, and have helped perform some of Alan's previous tasks for him. Despite his efforts to change events this time around, Emma is nevertheless consumed again by the darkness. Rachel is able to capture a longer portion of the signal this time, but it is still incomplete. When Alan returns to the drive-in theater, he is again unable to complete the new reality and is sent back in time again by Mr. Scratch.&#13;\nAlan repeats his actions for a third time, but this time, he is able to save Emma and gain the complete message from Rachel. He sets the correct series of events in the projection room, which triggers the projector to show a film made by Alice. Mr. Scratch appears again, but discovers that Alan has successfully written the new reality, and he is burned out of existence by the film. On the screen, Alan appears to reunite with Alice along a sun-lit shoreline; however, the narrator notes that this could quite possibly be just a figment of Alan's imagination, since he is still trapped in the Dark Place.&#13;\nDuring the credits, it is revealed that the name of the episode of Night Springs that Alan wrote himself into was titled \"Return\", a reference to the manuscript he began to type at the end of Special Two: The Writer.&#13;\nAfter completion of the game's credits, Barry wakes up suddenly, believing he has heard Alan's voice."], ["critic_rating", 69.7748508736794], ["time_to_beat", 14400], ["pegi_rating", 5], ["cover_img", "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/nefn5goepduo6ixacfjr.png"], ["video_url", "Dg02_suSIAQ"], ["release_date", "1329868800000"], ["genres", "{31}"], ["platforms", "{36,6}"], ["screenshots", "{https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/pdj3oj2k5bgc0wexddt6.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/wu139npcqcq58lxcf0qe.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/zvnk1n2tqiwh6x7otclo.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/twj9ushrvbym01k4ynia.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/hbpppia7u4cytseppaea.png}"], ["created_at", 2017-02-22 19:17:31 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-02-22 19:17:31 UTC]]

The game was developed by MercurySteam and published by Konami. This is MercurySteam's last contribution to the franchise. The story is set in both medieval and modern worlds.\n\nAs in the previous game, the player controls Gabriel Belmont, now known as Dracula, as he fights through an open world. During the game's opening sequence the player is able to control Dracula while he still possesses all his powers as well as all of his weapons. Dracula's main weapon is his Blood Whip, a weapon that is comparable to the Combat Cross from the original Lords of Shadow. Replacing the magic system from the previous game are the Void Sword and the Chaos Claws. The Void Sword can replenish Dracula's health when used while the Chaos Claws can be used to break through enemy defenses and deliver powerful attacks. The story mode in Lords of Shadow 2 has been stated to be far longer than the previous one. The game is mainly an open world allowing the player to choose what route to take. This game also features a movable camera, something that was not available in the first Lords of Shadow game.", "critic_rating"=>72.5322243046789, "time_to_beat"=>68400, "pegi_rating"=>5, "cover_img"=>"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/qpzs3xsa8w2gd0udwqig.png", "video_url"=>"PkS2t-l5fIs", "screenshots"=>["https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/bgjkqkdcrd9k8ilzkll5.png", "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/rppy2wpnhndvvdhp8r7b.png", "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/qubilam1xdnh6zt8ywxn.png", "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/pcqis0z9wxnrmqzgm2r4.png", "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/caonxswkwje73exyerqz.png"], "genres"=>[12, 25, 31], "platforms"=>[6, 12, 9], "release_date"=>"1393286400000"}, "user"=>{"id"=>1, "username"=>"Hudhayfa"}}, "id"=>"1"}

  Parameters: {"library"=>{"id"=>1, "played"=>false, "owned"=>true, "game"=>{"id"=>1, "title"=>"Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2", "description"=>"Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 is an action-adventure game and a sequel to the 2010 game, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow, and the 35th installment on the Castlevania franchise. The game was developed by MercurySteam and published by Konami. This is MercurySteam's last contribution to the franchise. The story is set in both medieval and modern worlds.\n\nAs in the previous game, the player controls Gabriel Belmont, now known as Dracula, as he fights through an open world. During the game's opening sequence the player is able to control Dracula while he still possesses all his powers as well as all of his weapons. Dracula's main weapon is his Blood Whip, a weapon that is comparable to the Combat Cross from the original Lords of Shadow. Replacing the magic system from the previous game are the Void Sword and the Chaos Claws. The Void Sword can replenish Dracula's health when used while the Chaos Claws can be used to break through enemy defenses and deliver powerful attacks. The story mode in Lords of Shadow 2 has been stated to be far longer than the previous one. The game is mainly an open world allowing the player to choose what route to take.

The game was developed by MercurySteam and published by Konami. This is MercurySteam's last contribution to the franchise. The story is set in both medieval and modern worlds.\n\nAs in the previous game, the player controls Gabriel Belmont, now known as Dracula, as he fights through an open world. During the game's opening sequence the player is able to control Dracula while he still possesses all his powers as well as all of his weapons. Dracula's main weapon is his Blood Whip, a weapon that is comparable to the Combat Cross from the original Lords of Shadow. Replacing the magic system from the previous game are the Void Sword and the Chaos Claws. The Void Sword can replenish Dracula's health when used while the Chaos Claws can be used to break through enemy defenses and deliver powerful attacks. The story mode in Lords of Shadow 2 has been stated to be far longer than the previous one. The game is mainly an open world allowing the player to choose what route to take.

The game was developed by MercurySteam and published by Konami. This is MercurySteam's last contribution to the franchise. The story is set in both medieval and modern worlds.\n\nAs in the previous game, the player controls Gabriel Belmont, now known as Dracula, as he fights through an open world. During the game's opening sequence the player is able to control Dracula while he still possesses all his powers as well as all of his weapons. Dracula's main weapon is his Blood Whip, a weapon that is comparable to the Combat Cross from the original Lords of Shadow. Replacing the magic system from the previous game are the Void Sword and the Chaos Claws. The Void Sword can replenish Dracula's health when used while the Chaos Claws can be used to break through enemy defenses and deliver powerful attacks. The story mode in Lords of Shadow 2 has been stated to be far longer than the previous one. The game is mainly an open world allowing the player to choose what route to take. This game also features a movable camera, something that was not available in the first Lords of Shadow game.", "critic_rating"=>72.5322243046789, "time_to_beat"=>68400, "pegi_rating"=>5, "cover_img"=>"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/qpzs3xsa8w2gd0udwqig.png", "video_url"=>"PkS2t-l5fIs", "release_date"=>"1393286400000", "genres"=>[12, 25, 31], "platforms"=>[6, 12, 9], "screenshots"=>["https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/bgjkqkdcrd9k8ilzkll5.png", "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/rppy2wpnhndvvdhp8r7b.png", "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/qubilam1xdnh6zt8ywxn.png", "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/pcqis0z9wxnrmqzgm2r4.png", "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/caonxswkwje73exyerqz.png"], "created_at"=>"2017-02-23T11:52:38.965Z", "updated_at"=>"2017-02-23T11:52:38.965Z"}}, "id"=>"1"}

During the game's opening sequence the player is able to control Dracula while he still possesses all his powers as well as all of his weapons. Dracula's main weapon is his Blood Whip, a weapon that is comparable to the Combat Cross from the original Lords of Shadow. Replacing the magic system from the previous game are the Void Sword and the Chaos Claws. The Void Sword can replenish Dracula's health when used while the Chaos Claws can be used to break through enemy defenses and deliver powerful attacks. The story mode in Lords of Shadow 2 has been stated to be far longer than the previous one. The game is mainly an open world allowing the player to choose what route to take.

The narration explains that Alan is attempting to chase down the \"herald of darkness\", Mr. Scratch, who is Alan's evil doppelganger created by a dark force. Scratch is determined to take away everything Alan loves, including his wife, Alice. Alan, as the \"champion of light,\" has the ability to rewrite reality, and was able to write his escape from Cauldron Lake in Washington. He ends up near the small town of Night Springs, Arizona, and learns that he has been missing from the real world for nearly two years.&#13;\nA nearby oil derrick erupts with several foes controlled by Mr. Scratch. Seeking light, Alan runs to a nearby motel, where he encounters Emma Sloan, who at first thinks he is Mr. Scratch, since they look identical. She tells Alan that Scratch was at the motel the night before, and provides Alan with a typewritten page, a way to alter reality to destroy the derrick and stop the foes. Alan follows its instructions, which causes a meteor to collide with an artificial satellite, sending it hurtling towards the ground, where it then collides with the oil derrick. While Alan is away performing this task, the dark forces consume Emma.&#13;\nFollowing clues he found at the motel, along with a set of keys, Alan heads to a nearby observatory. There, Dr. Rachel Meadows, who also met Mr. Scratch previously, is tracking a mysterious signal sent just before the satellite was knocked out of orbit. Rachel tells Alan that Mr. Scratch was very interested in this signal, and Alan surmises that it must contain the key to fighting the darkness. While attempting to obtain the complete signal, the observatory's telescope is sabotaged by the darkness, which reinforces Alan's belief that the signal contains something he needs. After repairing the damage, a portion of the signal comes through that translates into a page of a story: a new reality that Alan can presumably implement.&#13;\nThe page points him to a nearby drive-in theater, where he meets Serena Valdivia, who is under the influence of the darkness. After freeing her by restoring power and switching the lights on, Serena tells Alan that Mr. Scratch is trying to prevent the sun from ever rising again. She gives Alan the security code to the projection room where he can change reality. Alan uses the incomplete message to try to set the new reality. However, as the message is only partial, the new reality does not take effect. Mr. Scratch appears, gloating, and sends Alan back in time to a few hours before.&#13;\nWaking up again near the motel, Alan repeats many of the same motions. Emma and Rachel still have some deja vu of the previous loop's events, and have helped perform some of Alan's previous tasks for him. Despite his efforts to change events this time around, Emma is nevertheless consumed again by the darkness. Rachel is able to capture a longer portion of the signal this time, but it is still incomplete. When Alan returns to the drive-in theater, he is again unable to complete the new reality and is sent back in time again by Mr. Scratch.&#13;\nAlan repeats his actions for a third time, but this time, he is able to save Emma and gain the complete message from Rachel. He sets the correct series of events in the projection room, which triggers the projector to show a film made by Alice. Mr. Scratch appears again, but discovers that Alan has successfully written the new reality, and he is burned out of existence by the film. On the screen, Alan appears to reunite with Alice along a sun-lit shoreline; however, the narrator notes that this could quite possibly be just a figment of Alan's imagination, since he is still trapped in the Dark Place.&#13;\nDuring the credits, it is revealed that the name of the episode of Night Springs that Alan wrote himself into was titled \"Return\", a reference to the manuscript he began to type at the end of Special Two: The Writer.&#13;\nAfter completion of the game's credits, Barry wakes up suddenly, believing he has heard Alan's voice."], ["critic_rating", 69.7748508736794], ["time_to_beat", 14400], ["pegi_rating", 5], ["cover_img", "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/nefn5goepduo6ixacfjr.png"], ["video_url", "Dg02_suSIAQ"], ["release_date", "1329868800000"], ["genres", "{31}"], ["platforms", "{36,6}"], ["screenshots", "{https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/pdj3oj2k5bgc0wexddt6.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/wu139npcqcq58lxcf0qe.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/zvnk1n2tqiwh6x7otclo.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/twj9ushrvbym01k4ynia.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/hbpppia7u4cytseppaea.png}"], ["created_at", 2017-02-23 12:23:11 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-02-23 12:23:11 UTC]]

The game was developed by MercurySteam and published by Konami. This is MercurySteam's last contribution to the franchise. The story is set in both medieval and modern worlds.\n\nAs in the previous game, the player controls Gabriel Belmont, now known as Dracula, as he fights through an open world. During the game's opening sequence the player is able to control Dracula while he still possesses all his powers as well as all of his weapons. Dracula's main weapon is his Blood Whip, a weapon that is comparable to the Combat Cross from the original Lords of Shadow. Replacing the magic system from the previous game are the Void Sword and the Chaos Claws. The Void Sword can replenish Dracula's health when used while the Chaos Claws can be used to break through enemy defenses and deliver powerful attacks. The story mode in Lords of Shadow 2 has been stated to be far longer than the previous one. The game is mainly an open world allowing the player to choose what route to take. This game also features a movable camera, something that was not available in the first Lords of Shadow game."], ["critic_rating", 72.5322243046789], ["time_to_beat", 68400], ["pegi_rating", 5], ["cover_img", "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/qpzs3xsa8w2gd0udwqig.png"], ["video_url", "PkS2t-l5fIs"], ["release_date", "1393286400000"], ["genres", "{12,25,31}"], ["platforms", "{6,12,9}"], ["screenshots", "{https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/bgjkqkdcrd9k8ilzkll5.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/rppy2wpnhndvvdhp8r7b.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/qubilam1xdnh6zt8ywxn.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/pcqis0z9wxnrmqzgm2r4.png,https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/caonxswkwje73exyerqz.png}"], ["created_at", 2017-02-23 12:25:36 UTC], ["updated_at", 2017-02-23 12:25:36 UTC]]

  Parameters: {"library"=>{"id"=>6, "played"=>true, "owned"=>false, "game"=>{"id"=>1, "title"=>"Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2", "description"=>"Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 is an action-adventure game and a sequel to the 2010 game, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow, and the 35th installment on the Castlevania franchise. The game was developed by MercurySteam and published by Konami. This is MercurySteam's last contribution to the franchise. The story is set in both medieval and modern worlds.\n\nAs in the previous game, the player controls Gabriel Belmont, now known as Dracula, as he fights through an open world. During the game's opening sequence the player is able to control Dracula while he still possesses all his powers as well as all of his weapons. Dracula's main weapon is his Blood Whip, a weapon that is comparable to the Combat Cross from the original Lords of Shadow. Replacing the magic system from the previous game are the Void Sword and the Chaos Claws. The Void Sword can replenish Dracula's health when used while the Chaos Claws can be used to break through enemy defenses and deliver powerful attacks. The story mode in Lords of Shadow 2 has been stated to be far longer than the previous one. The game is mainly an open world allowing the player to choose what route to take. This game also features a movable camera, something that was not available in the first Lords of Shadow game.", "critic_rating"=>72.5322243046789, "time_to_beat"=>68400, "pegi_rating"=>5, "cover_img"=>"https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/qpzs3xsa8w2gd0udwqig.png", "video_url"=>"PkS2t-l5fIs", "screenshots"=>["https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/bgjkqkdcrd9k8ilzkll5.png", "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/rppy2wpnhndvvdhp8r7b.png", "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/qubilam1xdnh6zt8ywxn.png", "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/pcqis0z9wxnrmqzgm2r4.png", "https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/caonxswkwje73exyerqz.png"], "genres"=>[12, 25, 31], "platforms"=>[6, 12, 9], "release_date"=>"1393286400000", "comments"=>[]}, "user"=>{"id"=>2, "username"=>"Johnnie", "first_name"=>"Johnnie", "last_name"=>"de La Moriniere", "profile_img"=>"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/780714859700883456/E1vI9fK6_400x400.jpg"}}, "id"=>"6"}
